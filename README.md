# Animals, Wow!
## Why was this project created?
We created this application as a "cure to boredom". With technology nowadays it is becoming increasingly hard to grasp people's attention online. Our attention spans are getting shorter and shorter! We created this so users can search multiple animals multiple times and not only learn new things about those animals but see up to 8 silly little GIFs of them when they submit their search!

## What this project has taught us
Nick Burr: " This project taught me a lot about the value of collaboration in front-end development. Working with a team is a whole different game. It is easy to work solo and implement your own ideas. When it comes to communicating thoughts with others, a lotof nuance comes into play. Our group definitely overcame scheduling issues and learned the value of having a good team that checked in with one-another frequently. In addition to teamwork, building our own application taught me a lot about API's and how to interact with them. My Javascript and HTML skills developed a bit more just by the fact that I was using them creatively. Additionally working with others made me see new ways to accomplish things that in ways I had not thought of before.

P.J. Rasmussen: "This project taught me how to read other people's code a bit better; before this group project I sometimes would even struggle looking back at my own code and reading it if I didn't comment everything's functionality. Working in a group can definitely be challenging, and we all have different schedules outside of class which has been tricky but as soon as we decided on a solid idea and framework I think we really found our groove."

Brainstormed website ideas and came up with a top 4, decided to go with something that would be challenging yet feasible 

Created the repo from Nick's github, cloned it down to our individual machines and creating our respective branches

Had to go over the framework of the page a few times before we finally decided on a page layout

Delegated roles for styling and code

Spoke about how we would implement the acceptance criteria of the project into our repo
